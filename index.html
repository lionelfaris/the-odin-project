          <ul>
            <li><i>What is a web server?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Web server is computer that stores data. Whenever user search for a
            website on the web browser. The web browser's gonna ask the web
            server for the access. It's using TCP/IP and HTTP methods. If the
            web server agree to give the access, then it's gonna return the
            output to the user in form of website or web page.

            <li><i>What is a network?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Network is a minimum of two connected things, it could be people,
            computer, etc. Network allows us to communicate between one and
            others. For example, two connected Pc's is a network.

          <ul>
            <li><i>What is the internet?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The internet is a group of networks. It means that internet is more
            broad and global.

          <ul>
            <li><i>What is an IP Address?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            IP Address is the identity of any computers. It could be seen as
            home address. Whereas if there isn't a clear address, the packet
            could've gone to the wrong address or pc. It makes sure that the
            packet is sent correctly.

        <div class="pertanyaan-5">
          <ul>
            <li><i>What is a router?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Router is a device that's connecting one network and anothers.
            Router is very useful. Imagine if there are 20 of computers. Without
            router, we need to connect every single computer with another
            computer to be able to form a network. With router, we just need one
            that is placed in the middle, and the 20 computers just need to
            connect their cables to that router. That router will be a "bridge"
            to connect between one and other computers.

        <div class="pertanyaan-6">
          <ul>
            <li><i>What is an ISP?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ISP, as known as Internet Service Provider is just as simple as our
            wifi provider. For example, mine using MyRepublic. Our computers are
            not actually connected directly with the web server. Instead, our
            computer send a request to our ISP, then our ISP send it to the web
            server. So, at this point our ISP acts the same as router in term of
            the concept.

              <i>What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?</i>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Packets is a term of the data that being sent between a network.
            Basically, our data is being chunked first in the process of the
            transfer, then when it arrives to the target, the data is forming to
            the normal form again, imagine that process as a puzzle game. Why is
            that? That process actually make the data easier to transfer. One
            big chunk of data is harder to process than breaking it first into
            several small size of data.

          <ul>
            <li><i>What is a client?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A client is basically we as a user, or spesifically computer that we
            use daily. It's because our computer actually act as a customer
            that's "ordering" the "menu" from the "chef", in this context, the
            "chef" is a "web server."
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pertanyaan-10">
          <ul>
            <li><i>What is a server?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Server is a "chef" that's processing our data. Just like the real
            chef in a restaurant, server's usually invisible from the internet
            user. Actually, server itself is a one or more computer that stores
            and processes our data. Server's receiving request from the client.
            For example, when we search "google.com", we (as a client)
            requesting to the server to give us the web site or web page of the
            "google.com". From then, the server decides if it should give the
            access to the client or not. If the server's giving the access, then
            the we (as a client) are able to see "google.com" web page.

            <li><i>What is a web page?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A web page is what we're usually see when the first time opened the
            web site. One page of web site is already a web page. For example,
            index.html.

            <li><i>What is a web browser?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A web browser is the application used to search a website. For
            example google, duckduckgo, yahoo, edge, etc.

        <div class="pertanyaan-13">
          <ul>
            <li><i>What is a search engine?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Search engine is a tool provided by the web browser. For example,
            chrome is a web browser that's providing a google search engine to
            search on.

          <ul>
            <li><i>What is a DNS request?</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            DNS request is a process of looking for the right IP Address from
            the given domain. "google.com" is actually a simplified version of
            the google's IP Address. So, after we search "google.com", it's
            gonna verified the IP Address, then go to that Address. DNS (Domain
            Name System) is made to make the process of search easier for the
            user.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The processes are : First, user write the question -> enter to find
            the desired answer -> google.com is requesting the answer from the
            web server -> web server send the data to google.com -> google.com
            shows the output from the server to the user.
